An AI system that mimics human research by iteratively refining hypotheses using web data, NLP, and semantic search.

This 

Generates ideas,

Validates them using real-time web data,

Improves based on reasoning,

Links to past learnings,

And repeats this process until confident results are reached.

Powered by semantic search, DuckDuckGo, and NLP, it simulates intelligent, iterative scientific reasoning â€” all without relying on a traditional LLM.
